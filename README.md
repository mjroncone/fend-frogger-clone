===============================

To run the game:

Download all necessary files from the github repo:
https://github.com/mjroncone/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
by clicking "Download Zip" in the bottom-right corner of the
screen. Unpack all files into a single location, and then
use your browser to open up the file "index.html" found
in the game's main directory.

Directions:

The goal is to get across the road and over to the water
without running into any of the nasty bugs running across.

If you successfully make it across the road without getting
hit by any bugs, you will earn 100 points and the character's
position will reset to the starting location. Be careful though,
as running into any bugs will cost you 50 points and will also
reset the character's position to the starting location.

In the road, there will be three randomly-spawned gems each
worth 50 points if collected by running over them. Gems
re-spawn each time the player resets to home.

Controls:

"Up": pressing the up arrow will move the character up one space.
"Right": pressing the right arrow will move the character right one space.
"Down": pressing the down arrow will move the character down one space.
"Left": pressing the left arrow will move the character left one space.

That's it! Enjoy!

Note: Updates will be made to the game periodically, adding new features, styles,
and/or fixing any bugs that are discovered.
